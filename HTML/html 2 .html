<p style="color:darkblue" textsize="14">The Constitution of India (IAST: Bhāratīya Saṃvidhāna) is 
the supreme law of India.[3][4] The document lays down the framework that demarcates 
fundamental political code, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions 
and sets out fundamental rights, directive principles, and the duties of citizens. It is the longest 
written national constitution in the world.[5][6][7]
It imparts constitutional supremacy (not parliamentary supremacy, since it was created by a 
constituent assembly rather than Parliament) and was adopted by its people with a declaration in its 
preamble.[8] Parliament cannot override the constitution.

It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India on 26 November 1949 and became effective on 
26 January 1950.[9] The constitution replaced the Government of India Act 1935 as the country's 
fundamental governing document, and the Dominion of India became the Republic of India. To 
ensure constitutional autochthony, its framers repealed prior acts of the British parliament in Article 
395.[10] India celebrates its constitution on 26 January as Republic Day.[11]
The constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular,[12] and democratic republic, assures 
its citizens justice, equality, and liberty, and endeavours to promote fraternity.[13] The original 1950
constitution is preserved in a helium-filled case at the Parliament House in New Delhi. The words
"secular" and "socialist" were added to the preamble by 42nd amendment act in 1976 during the 
Emergency.[14]</p>
<br>
<br>
<p1 style="color:darkblue" textsize="14">In 1928, the All Parties Conference convened a committee 
in Lucknow to prepare the Constitution of India, which was known as the Nehru Report.[15]
Most of the colonial India was under British rule from 1857 to 1947. From 1947 to 1950, the same 
legislation continued to be implemented as India was a dominion of Britain for these three years, as 
each princely state was convinced by Sardar Patel and V.P.Menon to sign the articles of integration 
with India, and the British government continued to be responsible for the external security of the 
country.[16] Thus, the constitution of India repealed the Indian Independence Act 1947 and 
Government of India Act 1935 when it became effective on 26 January 1950. India ceased to be a 
dominion of the British Crown and became a sovereign, democratic and republic with the 
constitution. Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 60, 324, 366, 367, 379, 380, 388, 391, 392, 393, and 394 of the 
constitution came into force on 26 November 1949, and the remaining articles became effective on 
26 January 1950.[17]</p1>

<br>
<br>
<p2 style="color:green" textsize="16">The constitution was drawn from a number of sources. 
Mindful of India's needs and conditions, its framers borrowed features of previous legislation such as 
the Government of India Act 1858, the Indian Councils Acts of 1861, 1892 and 1909, the Government 
of India Acts 1919 and 1935, and the Indian Independence Act 1947. The latter, which led to the 
creation of India and Pakistan, divided the former Constituent Assembly in two. The Amendment act 
of 1935 is also a very important step for making the constitution for two new born countries. Each 
new assembly had sovereign power to draft and enact a new constitution for the separate 
states.[18]</p2>

<br>
<br>
<p3 style="color:darkblue" textsize="16">The constitution was drafted by the Constituent Assembly.
which was elected by elected members of the provincial assemblies.[19] The 389-member assembly 
(reduced to 299 after the partition of India) took almost three years to draft the constitution holding 
eleven sessions over a 165-day period.[5][18]
<br>
Having studied the constitutions of about 60 countries, Ambedkar was considered a wise 
constitutional expert. Ambedkar is recognised as the "Father of the Constitution of India".[20][21] In 
the constitution assembly, a member of the drafting committee, T. T. Krishnamachari said:<br>
<br>
Mr. President, Sir, I am one of those in the House who have listened to Dr. Ambedkar very carefully. I 
am aware of the amount of work and enthusiasm that he has brought to bear on the work of 
drafting this Constitution. At the same time, I do realise that that amount of attention that was 
necessary for the purpose of drafting a constitution so important to us at this moment has not been 
given to it by the Drafting Committee. The House is perhaps aware that of the seven members 
nominated by you, one had resigned from the House and was replaced. One died and was not 
replaced. One was away in America and his place was not filled up and another person was engaged 
in State affairs, and there was a void to that extent. One or two people were far away from Delhi and 
perhaps reasons of health did not permit them to attend. So it happened ultimately that the burden 
of drafting this constitution fell on Dr. Ambedkar and I have no doubt that we are grateful to him for 
having achieved this task in a manner which is undoubtedly commendable.[22][23]</p3>

<u><b><center><h1 style="color:red" textsize="16">Drafting</h1><center><b></u>
<br>
<br>
<p6 style="color:BLACK" textsize="16">Sir Benegal Narsing Rau, a civil servant who became the first
Indian judge in the International Court of Justice and was president of the United Nations Security 
Council, was appointed as the assembly's constitutional adviser in 1946.[25] Responsible for the 
constitution's general structure, Rau prepared its initial draft in February 1948.[25][26][27] The draft 
of B.N. Rau consisted of 243 articles and 13 schedules which came to 395 articles and 8 schedules 
after discussions, debates and amendments.[28]<br>
At 14 August 1947 meeting of the assembly, committees were proposed.[19] Rau's draft was 
considered, debated and amended by the eight-person drafting committee, which was appointed on 
29 August 1947 with B. R. Ambedkar as chair.[5][14] A revised draft constitution was prepared by 
the committee and submitted to the assembly on 4 November 1947.[14] Dr B. R. Ambedkar in his 
concluding speech in constituent assembly on 25 November 1949 stated that:[29]
<br>
While deliberating the revised draft constitution, the assembly moved, discussed and disposed off 
2,473 amendments out of a total of 7,635.[18][30] Before adopting the constitution, the assembly 
held eleven sessions in 165 days.[5][18] On 26 November 1949, it adopted the 
constitution,[5][18][14][27][31] which was signed by 284 members.[5][18][14][27][31] The day is 
celebrated as National Law Day,[5][32] or Constitution Day.[5][33] The day was chosen to spread the 
importance of the constitution and to spread thoughts and ideas of Ambedkar.[34]
<br>
The assembly's final session convened on 24 January 1950. Each member signed two copies of the 
constitution, one in Hindi and the other in English.[5][18][27] The original constitution is handwritten, with each page decorated by artists from Shantiniketan including Beohar Rammanohar 
Sinha and Nandalal Bose.[14][27] Its calligrapher was Prem Behari Narain Raizada.[14] The 
constitution was published in Dehradun and photolithographed by the Survey of India. Production of 
the original constitution took nearly five years. Two days later, on 26 January 1950, it became the 
law of India.[14][35] The estimated cost of the Constituent Assembly was ₹6.3 crore.[18] The 
constitution has had more than 100 amendments since it was enacted.[36]</p6>
